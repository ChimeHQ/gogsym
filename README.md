# gogsym

Go library for reading GSYM files.

GSYM is a binary file format useful for performing symbolication. It is much smaller and more efficient than using a dSYM.

A format definition can be derived from the LLVM [headers](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/include/llvm/DebugInfo/GSYM).
